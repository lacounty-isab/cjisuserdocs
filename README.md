# CJIS API Documentation Site

This repository is the source code for the CJIS API documentation site at

https://docs.codes.lacounty-isab.org/

The website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/),
a modern static website generator.  See their website for 
[installation instructions](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/installation).

The API specification docs were generated from the YAML definitions using
[ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc).

If you are interested in hosting API documentation of your own using
Docusaurus and ReDoc, the following template repository may help you:
