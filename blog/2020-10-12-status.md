ADABAS dumps of the charge code table (table `32757` in ADABAS parlance)
come with a "master ID" that is the DA's `template_id`.  Since the CJIS tables
in AWS aim to serve a wider audience than the DA, the `charge_code` table's
primary key will be decoupled from the template ID; though for most records
the two will coincide.

<!--truncate-->

To this end, a new `template_id` column was introduced to the `charge_code`
table to track `template_id`, including the tracking of a template ID's
absence.

```sql
alter table charge_code add column template_id int null unique;
```

While `template_id` is allowed to be `NULL`, it's still required to be
unique.  This will allow the DA to continue using template IDs as their
own primary key without preventing the additions of charges by external
agencies (such as *Cal DOJ*) with no concept of template ID.

The Web UI has been updated to allow filtering on `template_id`.
While the template ID is an integer, the filter matches based on a
`startsWith` condition on its string representation.
