The CJIS Code APIs are available in a TEST environment on AWS.
No production environment has been provisioned so far.
Work on a production environment will
not likely to proceed until an operational funding stream has
been identified.  As of yet, no resource funding has been allocated
to managed CJIS codes.  Only limited infrastructure funds, namely
AWS, have been allocated.  Staffing is allocated on a
free-time-available basis.

## Web UI

A Web UI is available for browsing the available codes.
The Web UI is hardly a professionally polished product.
Rather, it is more properly considered as a testing tool
for use by prospective API consumers.  (It is itself a
consumer of the API.)

Two potential sources of improvement for the API exist.

* A funding stream for ISAB to seek a vendor dedicated to Web UI
  development.

* Another agency with Web UI skills developers there own Web UI.
  APIs are [CORS](/docs/glossary#cors)-enabled so that anyone with
  an API key may publish a client.

The most distracting aspect of the Web UI presently is not so much
its lack of visual esthetic, but rather connection delays and failures
between the browser and the API.  Most of these issues seem to stem
from keep-alive connection attempts between the web server's reverse
proxy module and AWS's API Gateway listener.  The reverse proxy holds
connections closed by the API Gateway, which are then fail upon attempted
re-use.  I've reduced this somewhat by restricting HTTP protocol versions
between reverse-proxies and API Gateway to HTTP 1.0.

Another source of instability is that the Web UI is not "intellegent"
about determining when to refesh its state from the API.  It often
refeshes local state unnecessarily and neglects to refesh when needed.
I'll improve these as time and priority allows.

## API

The last code build/deploy was run on April 16, 2020.
It consists of the following codes.

### LEA

These codes were originally maintained in ADABAS `32756`.  The definitive
table is now the CCHRS LEA Master table where it is updated through its
own web interface.  For this reason, the current API is read-only.
The underlying table is refreshed from CCHRS periodically.  The last
refresh was March 2020.


### Charge Code

The charge code was the first code table implemented.  The definitive
version of this table is still ADABAS `32757`.  It is occasionally
refreshed via dump-and-load from ADABAS.  It is currently composed of
many ancillary statitical codes and internal codes particular to one
agency or another. 

:::caution Change Coming
The plan is to completely
overhaul this table based on the results of the charge evaluation
committee run by the California Department of Justice (Cal DoJ).
The ancillary codes, if still needed, will be maintained by the
individual agencies.
:::

Other ADABAS tables related to charge code are

* `32742` - Allegations
* `32726` - Special Allegations

The DA participates in the Cal-DOJ meetings to incorporate these as
required.

### Charge Conversion

This is an internal table used by ISAB to convert charge codes in PIX
messages as they are being passed between legacy systems with limited
abilities to evolve their data stores.  The original source was
ADABAS `32704`.

### Eye and Hair Color

These codes are short, simple and not subject to frequent change.

----------------------

## Security

API keys are available to any agency or development group with a
legitimate interest.

### User IDs

Individuals do not require authentication for read (HTTP GET) operations.
Update operations do require a login.  Currently the registry of users
is a private internal registry as are the authorization attributes.
Only a handful of county staff are authorized to **alter** data in a
CJIS code table.  This reduces the need to appeal to a global registry
that scales.

## Documentation

This documentation site is in the initial stages of development.
I tried several different documentation formats before I settled
on this static site generator,
[Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).
I am still learning the ins and outs of making the best use of it.
