We just released a
[CJIS Tables SDK](https://github.com/lacounty-isab/cjissdk)
to assist API consumers to get started with referencing
the CJIS Tables API in their applications.  This first release
features samples based on **.Net** and **JavaScript** platforms.

For each platform it demonstrates how to use a JSON Web
Token (JWT) library to generate a security token.
Such JWTs are required for  programmatic record updates.
A read request, which does not require a security token,
is also demonstrated.
