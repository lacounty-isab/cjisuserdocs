It's been another busy couple of months and lots of new changes.

## LEA Master Table

The LEA Master Table (AKA Arrest Agency, AKA ADABAS `32756`) has been hosted
on AWS since last April in readonly mode.  The update function was still hosted
on CCHRS infrastructure.  Beginning this month both read and update function are
hosted in AWS.  LEA updates feed the Arrest Agency notifications in Cloverleaf that
CCHRS had used.  No new mainframe transactions were required.

## Email Notifications

Individuals may now subscribe to email notifications of table updates on a
per-table basis.

## Notification Polling SDK

Both *synchronous* and *asynchronous* notifications have always been available for
table updates.  The notification mechanism is summarized in the diagram below.
On the left side the API server updates a database and sends a notification to
a *notification topic*.

Subscribers to the topic receive the notification either
*synchronously* or *asynchronously*.

|Subscriber | Mode | Description |
|-----------|------|------------------------------------------------------|
|Email | Asynchronous | Email notifications to individuals   |
|Queues | Asynchronous | Notification messages sit in queue until read by App |
|HTTP | Synchronous | Agency hosts API that is invoked immediately |


Asynchronous notification (i.e. polling an AWS queue for
notifications) sample code is now available through a
[Polling SDK](https://github.com/lacounty-isab/cjis-polling).

It includes sample use of the AWS SDK
for the following programming platforms.

* JavaScript (via Node.js)
* TypeScript (via Node.js)
* Java
* .Net

## UI Improvements

The Web UI has been continually updated based on user feedback.
The most notable will be the landing page, which used to contain
a form for selecting the backend API.  This requirement was
removed a long time ago and just confused people.  So it has
been replaced with links to the more popular tables.
