A few weeks ago I wrote about the addition of the `template_id` field and
how it relates to the master ID field in ADABAS.  One of the goals was to
decouple the `template_id` from the primary key.  But this has implications
for synchronization with ADABAS.  Any new charge lacking a `template_id`
will fail to be added to ADABAS since this constitutes the master ID
there.

<!--truncate-->

For a charge code that is created through the Web UI, the AWS-to-ADABAS
integration will send the `template_id` to ADABAS as the master ID.
For CJIS Tables **v1**, all new charge codes should have a template ID
in order to be compatible with ADABAS.  This may change in **v2** when
we deviate from ADABAS in order to align with the California Department
of Justice (Cal-DOJ) standard.
