The charge code update notifications only include the attributes of
a charge that were updated, along with its primary key.  Some systems
need the entire record in process the update.  To this end, a new charge
code endpoint was added that fetches a single charge by its ID.

One might wonder why such an obvious operation wasn't part of the original
set.  It's because we consider the primary key values *opague*.   They are
not meant to be generally known and they can change after a database refresh.
Today, of course, the primary keys are the DA's template ID.  But that will
go away with the next major version of the API designed to compatible with
Cal DOJ's state-wide charge code table, which will have no notion of
charge templates.
