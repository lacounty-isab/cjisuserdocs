In January ISAB received funding to provision the production environment
for the CJIS Tables.  Much of February and March was spent

* provisioning this environment,
* updating scripts and documentation,and
* testing.

The production environment is, topologically, identical to the
test environment, i.e. the same number of servers and load balancers.
In some cases, the production environment has servers that are a
little "beefier."

The last few remaining "loose ends" relate to notifications, mostly
in regard to the original ADABAS tables.  This will be approached in
phases.

| Phase | Data Entry                        | Notification |
|-------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| 1     | Sarah will update both AWS and ADABAS | Disabled |
| 2     | Sarah will update AWS                 | Enabled |
| 3     | DA will update AWS                    | Enabled |

The timelines for these phases will depend on external factors
such as the rate that other agencies are able to consume events
and training for data entry.  But the only obstacle for entring
phase 1 is data entry training and current production data.  We
should have that by the end of this month (April 2021).
