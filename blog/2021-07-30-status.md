It's been a busy couple of months and there have been lots of changes.

## Charge Code Delete

The `delete` operation for Charge Code was excluded from the interface
since, from a business perspective, charge codes are not deleted.  Rather,
they are expired so that older cases that reference them can still
generate accurate reports.  However, there are cases of duplicate entries
that were probably entered in error, rather than simply becoming obsolete
due to legislative or policy changes.
These cases might warrant an actual deletion.

However, this is complicated by the fact that some systems may reference
these entries, defective as they may be, in reports.  Such systems, upon
a `delete` notifications, would have to determine whether to truly delete
such a record or simply mark it as expired.  The latter raises the issue of
whether a deleted charge ID could be reused for a future charge.

Since the impact is still being investigated, authorization for the
Charge Code `delete` action is restricted to an admin user.

## CSV Download

The Charge Code Web UI now presents
a <button>Download CSV</button> button for downloading the entire
table as a CSV (comma separated value) file.  CSV Download support
will be coming to other tables soon.

## LEA Code Updates

The LEA codes have been readonly in AWS since changes have only been 
supported through the CCHRS web UI.  We are now migrating LEA code
edit support to the AWS web UI.  Prior to this, AWS LEA updates were
only made from CCHRS notification (through Cloverleaf).

## LEA Code Fetch

The single-parameter LEA code fetch operation was interpreted as a
*partial match* of a LEA code, potentially returning multiple matches.
This has been changed to an **exact match** to be consistent with
the corresponding operation for Charge Code.
